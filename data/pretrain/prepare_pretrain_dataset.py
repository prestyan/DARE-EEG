# Data preprocessing and splitting
# The code for this part of the data processing is currently being refined. 
# The processing method follows Appendix D of the paper.
# A pre-trained framework has been provided, and we are currently refining the data processing part to make it more easily reusable by others and to improve its readability.
#### IMPORTANT
# Because everyone has different expectations for the data, 
# we would like to preprocess the dataset you need according to your specific requirements or tasks (or the characteristics of the dataset itself).
